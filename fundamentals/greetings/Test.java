public class Test { // 1. Define a public class named Test.
    public static void main(String[] args) { // 2. Define a main method, the entry point of the program.
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // 3. Print "Hello World!" to the console.

/* Creating Your First Project:

Make a new folder named "greetings" in your Java assignments folder.
Inside "greetings", create a file called "Test.java".
In "Test.java", write this code:
java

Understanding the Main Method:

Every Java program has one class file with a main method.
Think of the main method as the starting point for your program.
File Naming:

The file name and class name must match exactly.
Start both the file name and class name with an uppercase letter.
Use Pascal case, which means starting each word with a capital letter.
Getting Started with Code:

Start by printing "Hello world!" to the console:

Compiling and Running Your Code:

Compile your Java program using javac NameOfFile.java.
Fix any errors that show up during compilation.
Run your program with java NameOfFile.
When you compile, if nothing shows up, it means the file compiled successfully.
After compiling, a ".class" file is created, which is what the computer runs.
When you run the code, you don't need to include ".class" in the command.
Remember: Every time you make a change to your code, you need to re-compile it.
